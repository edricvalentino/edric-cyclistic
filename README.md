# Study Case - Cyclistic
## Identifying different behavior between groups of user

Cyclistic is a bike-share company in Chicago. Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members. Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, management team believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. In order to design new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual member, the team need to better how annyal members and casual riders differ.
